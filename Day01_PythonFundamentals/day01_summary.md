# Day 1 - Summary

**What I reviewed:**
- Python basics: variables, loops, functions, list comprehensions, dictionaries
- Practiced simple, filtered, and nested list comprehensions

**What I already knew:**
- Basic variables and loops felt familiar
- Writing simple functions came naturally

**What I struggled with:**
- Nested list comprehensions â€” had to slow down and break them into regular loops first

**Next steps:**
- Practice more nested comprehensions
- Start using comprehensions inside functions for efficiency
